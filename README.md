# Sales-Dataset-in-PowerBI  

This project focuses on **visualizing a sales dataset** using **Power BI**. The dashboard provides insights into **total sales, profit distribution, and yearly trends**, along with an interactive slicer for filtering data.

## Project Overview  

In this project, I created the following **visualizations** in Power BI:  

- **Total Sales by Category (Stacked Column Chart)**: Displays total sales across different product categories.  
- **Top 5 Profit by Country (Map)**: Highlights the top five countries with the highest profit.  
- **Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit by Year (Line Chart)**: Shows trends in sales and profit over time.  

Additionally, a **slicer filter** allows users to refine the data for a more detailed analysis.  

## Visualizations  

### 1. **Total Sales by Category (Stacked Column Chart)**  
- Visualizes total sales across different product categories.  
- Helps identify the best-performing categories.  

### 2. **Top 5 Profit by Country (Map)**  
- Displays the top five countries with the highest profit.  
- Provides a geographical overview of sales performance.  

### 3. **Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit by Year (Line Chart)**  
- Tracks yearly trends for total sales and profit.  
- Helps understand business growth and seasonal patterns.
